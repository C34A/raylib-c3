# Raylib-C3

This is my feeble attempt at making [C3](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c) language
bindings for [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

This project is a work in progress and is not currently functional.

## usage

```
python3 gen.py
python3 gen2.py
```

at this point, you should be able to use the generated `raylib.c3`.
